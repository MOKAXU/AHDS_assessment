# Does the frequency of eating rice/grain rice have an effect on BMI?

## Overview
Rice has long been an important staple food for the world's population. High in starch, easily digestible, and with a rapid rise in blood glucose, these attributes of rice were often seen in the past as an advantage because of its ability to produce a quick feeling of fullness and provide energy. In recent decades, however, a new trend has emerged whereby eating staple grains with a higher fibre content, which take longer to digest, is seen as a "healthier", or better-for-you, choice. In addition to the gut-health benefits of fibre, it is thought that because these coarse grains are harder to digest, blood sugar rises and falls more slowly, with lower peaks than with more easily digested staple foods. In other words, blood sugar will fluctuate to a lesser extent. In the long run, people who eat grain rice are thought to possibly become slimmer.
